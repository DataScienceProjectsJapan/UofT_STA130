# Week 0

## January 5 Tutorial

There are no tutorials on January 5.  Instead of attending tutorial we suggest that you spend some time getting acquainted with the basics of [R](https://www.r-project.org).  We will be using R throughout the course.

The first classes are on January 8.  Before you come to class do the following:

0. Read through the [course syllabus](STA130syllabus2018S.html)

1. Read the [R resources section](R_resources.html) of the course webpage.  Make sure to login to http://rstudio.chass.utoronto.ca/ (see [R resources section](R_resources.html) for more details).

2. Sign up for the [Piazza discussion forum](https://piazza.com/utoronto.ca/winter2018/sta130h1/home).

3. Get introduced to R.  Two ways to get you started are:

(i) Complete [Datacamp's](https://www.datacamp.com) free online [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

(ii)  Read chapters 1, 2, and 3 of [Hands-On Programming with R, by Garrett Grolemund](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ighbo26t3ua52t/igp9099yy4v10/igz7vp4w5su9/OReilly_HandsOn_Programming_with_R_2014.pdf).  

You can do both (i) and (ii), but a lot of the same content is covered. If you decide to only complete the readings then make sure to type the commands into the console window in RStudio.
