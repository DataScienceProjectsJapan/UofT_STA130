## Course Office Hours
This course is team-taught.  The intructor who teaches you each Monday will be available for the hour after each lecture.   During the week, there will be many office hours staffed by the course teaching assistants.  The schedule of the TA office hours will be posted as soon as it is available.

## Course Schedule

### _Lectures_
- **Mondays:** Lecture either 10am-noon in PB B150 or 2pm-4pm in WB 116.
- There are no lectures on Monday, February 19 (Family Day).   
On Monday April 2 your lecture section will meet in the Bahen Atrium for project presentations.

### _Tutorials_
- **Fridays:** Tutorial either 10am-noon or 2pm-4pm, corresponding to your lecture time.    Your tutorial assignment and location will be posted on the the UofT Portal page for the course <https://portal.utoronto.ca/>. To receive course credit for tutorials you should only attend the tutorial in which you are enrolled.  

- There are no tutorials on the following Fridays:  
      + January 5. You should complete the online orientation to R and R Studio in lieu of this tutorial.  
      + February 23 (Reading Week)  
      + March 2 (Term test)  
      + March 30 (Good Friday)

#### _Preparation_
- **In between Mondays and Fridays:** On Mondays, you will be provided with work to do in preparation for that Friday's tutorial.  This may include computational work, readings, and/or practice problems.  Often you will be required to submit part of this work before tutorial and to bring part of this completed work to the tutorial.

## Course Description and Learning Objectives

Statistics is about how we can learn from data.  Data Science is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that also includes the computational aspects of carrying out a data analysis, including acquisition, management, and analysis of data. Statistical reasoning and computing with data play important roles in this emerging discipline.  The purpose of this course is to give you a broad introduction to many of the ways statisticians learn from data.  Learning from data involves computation and communication.  We will use the R programming language and environment for statistical computing, and tutorials will introduce students to communicating statistical knowledge.   

#### Learning objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Describe how statistical methods can be used to learn from data, including methods for description, explanation, and prediction.

- Carry out a variety of statistical analyses in R and interpret the results of the analyses.

- Implement the computational steps involved in the management and statistical analysis of data using R.

- Identify appropriate uses of statistical methods to answer questions, including their strengths and limitations.

- Clearly communicate the results of a data analysis to both technical and non-technical audiences. 

## Topics 

- Data visualization
- Data wrangling and summarizing data
- Statistical testing and estimation
- Statistical models for description and prediction
- Supervised and unsupervised statistical learning
- Ethical issues in data collection and analysis

1. Your tutorial grade includes any assigned work that is due before tutorial and any work done during tutorial.  Note that if you miss a tutorial, there is no way to make up this component of your mark.

2. If you are enrolled in the 10-12 lecture section then your tutorial will be on Friday 10-12, and if you are enrolled in the 2-4 lecture section then your tutorial will be on Friday 2-4.  



## Missed Tests or Assignments

- If a test or tutorial work is missed for a valid medical reason, you must submit the University of Toronto Verification of [Student Illness or Injury form](http://www.illnessverification.utoronto.ca) within one week of the test.  Submit the form to your TA if it is related to missed tutorial work.  Submit the form to your instructor if it is related to the test.  If your last (family) name starts with A-L, contact [Prof. Gibbs](mailto:alison.gibbs@utoronto.ca).  If your last (family) name starts with M-Z, contact [Prof. Taback](mailto:nathan.taback@utoronto.ca).
- The form will only be accepted as valid if the form is filled out according to the instructions on the form.
- The form must indicate that the degree of incapacitation on academic functioning is moderate, serious, or severe in order to be considered a valid medical reason for missing the term test. If the form indicates that the degree of incapacitation on academic functioning is negligible or mild then this will NOT be considered a valid medical reason.
- If a tutorial is missed for a valid reason then the weight for that tutorial work will be shifted to the remaining tutorials.
- If the term test is missed for a valid reason then the weight for the test will be shifted to the final exam.  In other words, the final exam will be worth 57% of your final grade.  
- Other reasons for missing an assignment, tutorial work, or the term test will require prior approval by your instructor. If your last (family) name starts with A-L, contact [Prof. Gibbs](mailto:alison.gibbs@utoronto.ca).  If your last (family) name starts with M-Z, contact [Prof. Taback](mailto:nathan.taback@utoronto.ca). If prior approval is not received for non-medical reasons then you will receive a grade of zero for the missed assignment, tutorial work, or test.

## Marking Concerns

Any requests to have your test remarked must contain a written justification for consideration.  Marking requests should be made within one week of receiving your test.  Please note that we reserve the right to look at all questions on your test when you re-submit an assessment for reconsideration.

## How to Communicate with Your Instructors

Questions about course material or organization, such as,
  
- What do I change the colour of my plotting symbol?
- How do I do question 3.7 in the textbook? 
- What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
- When is the term test?

should be posted on the discussion forums on Piazza or asked in person. Questions can be posted anonymously (so that the author is anonymous to other students but not to the instructors), if desired.

If your communication is private, such as, I missed the test because I was ill, then e-mail [Prof. Gibbs](mailto:alison.gibbs@utoronto.ca) if your last (family) name starts with A-L and [Prof. Taback](mailto:nathan.taback@utoronto.ca) if you your last (family) name starts with M-Z.  If you missed a tutorial then e-mail your TA.   Use your utoronto.ca e-mail account to ensure that your message doesn’t automatically go to a Junk folder and include your full name and student number.


## Academic Integrity

You are responsible for knowing the content of the [University of Toronto’s Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm).

As a general rule, we encourage you to discuss course material with each other and ask others for advice.  However, it is not permitted to share complete solutions or to directly share code for anything that is to be handed in.  When an assignment is required to be completed as a team, you may share solutions and code with other members of your team, but not with another team in the class.  For example, "For question 2.1 what R function did you use?" is a fair question; "Please show me your R code for question 2.1" is not.

If you have any questions about what is or is not permitted in this course, please do not hesitate to contact your instructor ([Prof. Gibbs](mailto:alison.gibbs@utoronto.ca) if your last (family) name starts with A-L and [Prof. Taback](mailto:nathan.taback@utoronto.ca) if your last (family) name starts with M-Z).

## Accessibility Needs

The University of Toronto is committed to accessibility. If you require accommodations for a disability, or have any accessibility concerns about the course, the class room, or course materials, please contact Accessibility Services as soon as possible: <accessibility.services@utoronto.ca> or <http://accessibility.utoronto.ca>

## Your Responsibilities

The course is designed to actively engage you in the course material. We hope you’ll find the statistical reasoning and data science interesting, challenging, and fun. In order for classroom sessions and tutorials to be effective, prepare by learning about the week’s concepts through completing the recommended problems and readings.
