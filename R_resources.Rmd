There are lots of free resources available for learning R.  This page contains some excellent resources, but we certainly can't list all the excellent resources available.

# Running R

[R](https://www.r-project.org) is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.  R can be freely downloaded at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org).

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) is a popular integrated development environment for R.  A desktop version is available to [download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) on to your personal computer for free. 

We have setup a version of RStudio that STA130 students can access from any web browser at http://rstudio.chass.utoronto.ca/. This can be used for all computing in the course.  Only STA130H1S students will have access. This has all R libraries installed that you will require to complete course assignments.  **Note that RStudio does not currently work properly on [mobile devices](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/217801028-Can-I-run-RStudio-IDE-Shiny-Server-on-a-mobile-device-).**


# Getting Started with R

- If you have never programmed before then [Hands-On Programming with R, by Garrett Grolemund](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ighbo26t3ua52t/igp9099yy4v10/igz7vp4w5su9/OReilly_HandsOn_Programming_with_R_2014.pdf) is a great place to start.
- [R for Data Science, by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) is a wonderful resource. 
- [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com) offers a free online [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).


# R Markdown 

[R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) documents can be used to create documents that weave together code and text.  

An R Markdown Cheat Sheet downloaded from [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) is available [here](rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).

A guide to producing R Markdown documents for class assignments is available [here](Rmarkdownforclassreports.html).  This guide also includes a short introduction to $\LaTeX$ for including math in R Markdown.

# Getting Help with R

Students can always ask a member of the teaching staff for help during office hours, tutorial, or on the class [discussion forum](https://piazza.com/utoronto.ca/winter2018/sta130h1/home).

[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is a popular forum for posting and answering questions related to programming.  Questions tagged R can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) and questions tagged RStudio can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rstudio).
